# SMS Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: SMS Shows "Sent" but Not Received

### Why This Happens:
1. **Twilio Trial Account Restrictions**: Trial accounts can only send SMS to verified phone numbers
2. **Phone Number Not Verified**: Your phone number needs to be verified in Twilio first
3. **Trial Account Limitations**: Trial accounts have "Sent from your Twilio trial account" prefix

### Solutions:

#### Option 1: Verify Your Phone Number (Recommended)
1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to "Phone Numbers" → "Manage" → "Verified Caller IDs"
3. Add your phone number `+17204995415`
4. Verify it via SMS or call
5. Test again - SMS should now be delivered

#### Option 2: Upgrade Twilio Account
1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to "Billing" → "Upgrade Account"
3. Add a payment method
4. Upgrade to a paid account
5. SMS will work without restrictions

#### Option 3: Test with Different Phone Numbers
- Try sending to a different phone number that's already verified
- Or use a friend's number for testing

### Current Status:
- ✅ SMS API is working (status: "queued")
- ✅ Twilio credentials are correct
- ❌ Phone number needs verification for delivery

### Quick Test:
Try sending an SMS to a different number to confirm the system works.

### For Production:
Once you verify your phone number or upgrade your account, all SMS notifications will work perfectly!
